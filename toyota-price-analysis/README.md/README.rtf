##  Objectives\
\
1. Load and explore the dataset  \
2. Clean and prepare data for analysis  \
3. Compute the correlation matrix  \
4. Identify the top predictors of car price  \
5. Build a foundation for future linear regression modeling  \
6. Publish the project publicly on GitHub  \

##  Dataset Overview\
\
**Rows:** 6,738  \
**Columns:** 9  \
**Features include:**\
\
- `model`\
- `year`\
- `price`\
- `transmission`\
- `mileage`\
- `fuelType`\
- `tax`\
- `mpg`\
- `engineSize`\
\
The target variable is **price**.\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56589  Correlation Analysis Findings\
\
Correlation revealed that the **top three indicators influencing price** are:\
\
###  1. Engine Size (0.73)\
Vehicles with larger engines are priced higher, indicating strong positive influence.\
\
###  2. Year (0.42)\
Newer cars cost more; depreciation happens over time.\
\
###  3. Mileage (\'960.30)\
Higher mileage reduces vehicle value.\
\
These three features will be used in future modeling steps (e.g., linear regression).\

##  Methods Used\
\
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)\
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
- Correlation Matrix & Heatmap\
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing\
- Notebook-based analysis in Jupyter\
\
---\
\
##  Example Visualizations\
\
- Correlation heatmap  \
- Distribution plots for mileage, price, engine size  \
- Scatterplots exploring relationships\
\
*(All visualizations are included inside the notebook.)*\

\
##  Next Steps (Future Work)\
\
- Build a **linear regression model** using key predictors  \
- Evaluate model accuracy (MAE, RMSE, R\'b2)  \
- Visualize regression line and residuals  \
- Explore additional models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  \
- Perform feature engineering  \
